#  Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The insights can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and improve retention.

##  Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Identify meaningful customer segments using clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

**Dataset Used:**  
A pre-cleaned customer dataset containing fields like:
- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Gender  
- Other derived behavioral metrics

##  Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations  
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (PCA)  
- Model building using:
  - **K-Means**
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
  - **DBSCAN**
- Cluster evaluation using:
  - Silhouette Score  
  - Davies-Bouldin Index  
  - Calinski-Harabasz Score  
- Final visualization of clusters with annotations
